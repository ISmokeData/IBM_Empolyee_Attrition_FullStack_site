st.title('IBM Attrition Prediction')

st.write("""This project leverages machine learning to analyze and predict employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. By exploring various
          features like age, job role, satisfaction level, and other employee attributes, the model provides insights into factors contributing to 
          attrition. Key techniques include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and implementing classification algorithms
            for predictive modeling. The project aims to help organizations make informed decisions to improve employee retention strategies.""")
